            <p>The new dscout Diary took about a year to revamp. Product and engineering implemented a new experience that improves how projects are structured.

            <p>Our goal for bringing mission parts to reality for our customers cooked for a year. We delivered the enhanced dscout Diary experience in late 2017.

            <p>The invites feature launched to facilitate the process of building and launching a research study with dscout.

With invites, we focused on the invitation of research participants to a researcher’s project....</p>
