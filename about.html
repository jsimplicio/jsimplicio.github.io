  <h2>About</h2>

  <p>I grew up with a computer in my room, and was thankful that I learned to code and design websites at a very young age. I was surfing the web during the dot-com bubble while starting to experiment with hypertext.</p>
  <p>I ended up becoming a software product designer and front-end engineer designer. I have over 6 years of experience that were spent researching, designing, and developing software products used by hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

  <p>I am currently building social media management software products at <a target="_blank" title="Sprout Social" href="https://sproutsocial.com">Sprout Social</a>, serving and connecting people with powerful social media tools.
  </p>

  <p>In the past, I have:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>Designed and developed research products at <a target="_blank" title="dscout mobile research" href="https://dscout.com">dscout</a>.</li>
    <li>Designed e-commerce experiences for <a target="_blank" href="http://threadless.com" title="Threadless">Threadless</a> and their service <a href="https://www.threadless.com/artist-shops/signup/art" title="Artist Shops">Artist Shops</a>.</li>
    <li>Designed for Basecampers, and for <a href="https://thedistance.com" target="_blank" title="The Distance">The Distance</a> at <a target="_blank" href="http://basecamp.com" title="Basecamp">Basecamp</a>.</li>
  </ul>
