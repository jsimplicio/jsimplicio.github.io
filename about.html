  <p>I specialize in product and systems design, and front-end development. I have over 6 years of experience in user research, interface designing, front-end developing, and testing software used by hundreds of thousands of people.</p>
    
  <p>I was born and raised in São Paulo, Brazil. I currently live with my partner and our two cats in the beautiful Humboldt Park neighborhood of Chicago. In my spare time, you can find me spinning house music records and skateboarding.
