  <h2>About me</h2>
  
  <p>I grew up with a computer in my room, and am thankful that I learned to design and code websites at a very young age. I was surfing the web during the dot-com bubble while starting to experiment with hypertext.</p>
  <p>I ended up becoming a software product designer and front-end engineer designer. I have over 6 years of experience that were spent researching, designing, testing, and developing software experiences used by hundreds of thousands of people.</p>

  <p>I am currently living in Chicago, and building software products at <a target="_blank" title="Sprout Social" href="https://sproutsocial.com">Sprout Social ↗</a>. I help people make powerful connections through social media management tools.
