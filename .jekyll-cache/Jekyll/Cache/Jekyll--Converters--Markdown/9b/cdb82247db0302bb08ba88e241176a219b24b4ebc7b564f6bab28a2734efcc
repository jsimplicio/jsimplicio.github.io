I"ƒ<p>At dscout, I spent over two years helping build Particle, our first component library.</p>

<p>Dscout went through a major platform re-design that started as a trial on some parts of the system. This re-design was built with the building blocks of particle. The system is built on React, and back when it first started I generated its counter part UI kit in Sketch for the team.</p>

<p>I took what our lead designer, Timo Kuhn, created and documented it in Sketch, eventually turning my documentation into a comprehensive and re-usable UI kit. Some of the components and interface bits themselves were also designed and created by me.</p>
