I"Ù<p>I built Sprout Socialâ€™s Figma file organization plugin for the product design team. It all started with one of our lead product designers coming up with a system for file covers that represent projects, and pages that divide designs according to what stage of the process theyâ€™re at. The goal was to turn this into a template for everyone, so that it would be easier for designers, engineers, and PMs to navigate anyone elseâ€™s files.</p>
