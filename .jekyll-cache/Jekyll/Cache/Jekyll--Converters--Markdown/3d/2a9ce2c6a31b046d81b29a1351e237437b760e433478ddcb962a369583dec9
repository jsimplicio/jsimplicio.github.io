I"Ô<p>During Sprout Socialâ€™s recent major platform re-design, I helped our engineering and product design teams by identifying patterns across the app which could be re-usable components in our new design system, Seeds. The empty state component was my first major contribution to Seeds, where I identified a need, researched and designed the component upon receiving team feedback, and shipped it to our system.</p>

<p>The empty state component has properties that can be used when needed. The image is required but the title, description, and button are options one can take to build an empty state in Sprout. Below are a few examples in-app.</p>

	<figcaption class="media-caption center">Empty State for Find Content inside Sprout Social</figcaption>
</figure>

	<img src="../../../../../../assets/images/empty-state-3.png" title="Empty State for the Inbox based on filter selection inside Sprout Social" />
	<figcaption class="media-caption center">Empty State for the Inbox based on filter selection inside Sprout Social</figcaption>

<figure>
	<img src="../../../../../../assets/images/empty-state-4.png" title="Empty State for failed posts inside Sprout Social" />
	<figcaption class="media-caption center">Empty State for failed posts inside Sprout Social</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>One thing I would do differently in the future is only accept SVGs so that we can programatically assign the accent color ourselves. As you can see in my examples very similar but different hues of blue from our design system color palette were uploaded as a PNG accidentaly by different designers.</p>
