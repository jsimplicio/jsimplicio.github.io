I"î<p>The Diary team launched a new Analysis tab with improvements that give researchers the ability to quantify data from open-ended answers. Close-ended answers can be easier to quantify in charts, like the data seen in the Summary tab.</p>

<div class="problem-statement"> 
  <h2>Problem statement</h2>
  <p>Researchers want to make meaningful data patterns from answers to open-ended questions.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="objective">Objective</h2>
<ul>
  <li>The Analysis feature has features that help researchers researchers get a quick understanding of open-ended answers through tools that generate patterns.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="key-result">Key Result</h2>
<ul>
  <li>Researchers can quickly create meaningful value out of answers to open-ended questions.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="the-features">The features</h2>
<p>The following images belong to a research project that examined the experience of customers that were provided a trial of the <a href="https://www.birchbox.com/">Birchbox</a> service, a personalized box delivery subscription.</p>

<p>The following are screenshots on the analysis of one of the open-ended questions in the Birchbox project: ‚ÄúIs there anything that‚Äôs surprising or unexpected, in terms of contents of your box or the overall experience?‚Äù</p>

<p>The following are the filter tools provided for word analysis:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Question picker</li>
  <li>Filter top words (10, 25, or 50)</li>
  <li>See and filter words by part of speech</li>
  <li>Filter based on the rating of responses (positive, negative, or unrated)</li>
  <li>Eliminate words from the chart by adding them to a stop word list</li>
</ul>
