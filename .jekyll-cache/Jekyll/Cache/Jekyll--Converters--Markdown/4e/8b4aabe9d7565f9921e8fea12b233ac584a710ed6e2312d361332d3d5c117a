I"$<p>At dscout, I spent over two years helping build Particle, our first component library.</p>

<p>Dscout went through a major platform re-design that started as a trial on some parts of the system. This re-design was built with the building blocks of particle. The system is built on React, and back when it first started I generated its counter part UI kit in Sketch for the team.</p>

<p>I took what our lead product designer Timo Kuhn started creating, and I documented it in Sketch, which eventually turned into a comprehensive and re-usable UI kit that was adopted by dscoutâ€™s product designers. Some of the components and interface bits themselves were designed and shipped to our component library by me.</p>

<p>Although dscout at the time was not ready to release a perusable design system with product style guidelines and standards, the component library served as the stepping stones for a future system.</p>

<p>In terms of adoption, dscout designers utilized the UI kit for designing and prototyping anything from small product ideas, to new features. The UI Kit in Sketch was the foundation that inspired the future switch to the modern design tool Figma for component design at dscout.</p>
