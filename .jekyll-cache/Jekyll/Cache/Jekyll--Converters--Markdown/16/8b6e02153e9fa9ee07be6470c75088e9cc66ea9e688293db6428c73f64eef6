I"»<p>I built Sprout Socialâ€™s Figma first Figma plugin, a file setup and organizer for the product design team. It all started with one of our lead product designers coming up with a system for file covers that represent projects, plus page designs that divide content according to what stage the design is at. The goal of templates was to help everyone in the team organize their files in a way that would be easy for designers, engineers, and product managers to navigate any designerâ€™s   files.</p>
