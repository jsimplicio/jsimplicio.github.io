I"…<p>Threadless recently released Artist Shops, a platform for artists to sell their designs printed on a variety of different products, including apparel and wall art. The service provides shop owners with their own customizable e-commerce site, while handling the transactions, printing services, delivery, and customer support. The Manage Products section of the dashboard provides shop owners access to their collection of products and designs, and the ability to edit their styles, prices, and publishing status.</p>

<h3 id="master-story-list">Master Story List</h3>
<ul>
  <li>Shop owners should be able to edit the pricing of products</li>
  <li>Shop owners should be able to publish or unpublish products and designs</li>
  <li>Shop owners should be able to add/remove product properties: for garments they should be able to edit garment colors, and for wall art they should be able to edit frame colors and choose the size(s) of the canvas</li>
  <li>Shop owners should be able to order product samples</li>
  <li>Shop owners should be able to share a product or design to social media outlets</li>
  <li>Shop owners should be able to bulk edit the pricing of all products in one category (example: all men‚Äôs t-shirts)</li>
  <li>A link for accessing the page where shop owners can edit each design, and subsequently, all products pertaining to them</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="managing-products">Managing Products</h3>
<p>We listed all designs and products on a table. The products can be filtered by category (Men‚Äôs, Women‚Äôs, Kids, and Wall Art), and product type (T-Shirts, Sweatshirts, Wall Art, etc.). The filtering is meant to facilitate the process of editing all shop‚Äôs items in an organized fashion. The designs table lets shop owners publish or unpublish a design, and see how many products are under a specific design.</p>

<p>We successfully included all of our goal‚Äôs needs, while still leaving plenty of space for future requirements. We have a list of ideas that we still would like to include such as  the ability for shop owners to replace and edit the design on each product.</p>

<h3 id="usability-tests">Usability tests</h3>
<p>We conducted usability testing with a few shop owners, both in person and through google hangouts. We compiled our results in order to pinpoint positives and negatives that we should work on.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Not all shop owners knew what ‚ÄòMSRP‚Äô stands for</li>
  <li>Shop owners want to preview the actual garments for each color option</li>
  <li>Shop owners want to preview the product they are currently editing (accurate product type and color/style combinations)</li>
  <li>Shop owners had a hard time entering tags while editing a design‚Äîthey didn‚Äôt know how to enter it‚Äîone at a time? Comma separated?). Shop owners often didn‚Äôt successfully keep their tags because our interface currently forces users to also hit ‚Äúsave updates‚Äù after every time they hit ‚Äúadd tag‚Äù</li>
  <li>Shop owners want to be able to edit and view their design inside the products printable boundaries</li>
</ul>

<p>Below are sketches that I created before designing high fidelity wireframes. The idea for Manage Products originated with the table of products from the start. After many back and forth feedback sessions, and usability testing, I arrived at the high fidelity solutions below the preliminary sketches. The final wireframes took many iterations where my goal was to include all the necessary parts for shop owners to be able to manage and edit their products and designs in one place.</p>
