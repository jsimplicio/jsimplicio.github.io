I"S<p>After being tasked to design an experience for loading content at separate speeds on Sproutâ€™s month view calendar, I was inspired by our analytics team use of a skeleton of the UI for loading content that is being fetched.</p>

<figure>
	<img src="../../../../../../assets/images/skeleton-1.png" title="Use of a skeleton loaders in Analytics" />
	<figcaption class="media-caption center">Use of a skeleton loaders in Analytics</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>I took a pattern inside the Analytics portion of our app, and brought it to our design system Seeds, so that we could all share it.</p>
