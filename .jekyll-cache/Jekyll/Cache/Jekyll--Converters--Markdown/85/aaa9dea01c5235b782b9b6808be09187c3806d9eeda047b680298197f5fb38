I"©<p>I built Sprout Socialâ€™s Figma first Figma plugin, a file setup and organizer for the product design team. It all started with one of our lead product designers coming up with a system for file covers that represent projects, plus page designs that divide designs according to what stage of the process theyâ€™re at. The goal was to turn this into a template for everyone, so that it would be easier for designers, engineers, and product managers to navigate anyoneâ€™s files.</p>
