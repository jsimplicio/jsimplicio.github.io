I"N<p>I was tasked to design an experience for content that loads at separate speeds on Sprout’s month view calendar. I was inspired by our analytics team use of a skeleton of the UI for loading content.</p>

<p>I researched skeleton loaders, and learned that they provide a perceived performance experience to users, making them feel like there’s 0 to no wait time when content loads. Perceived performance is achieved when we load the skeleton of the content that will be loaded.</p>

<p>I took a pattern inside the Analytics portion of our app, and brought it to our design system Seeds, so that we could all share it across the product.</p>
