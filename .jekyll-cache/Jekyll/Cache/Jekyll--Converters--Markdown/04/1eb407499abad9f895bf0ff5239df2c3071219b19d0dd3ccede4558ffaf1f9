I"¡<p>During Sprout Socialâ€™s recent major platform re-design, I helped our engineering and product design teams by identifying patterns across the app which could be re-usable components in our new design system, Seeds. The empty state component was my first major contribution to Seeds, where I identified a need, researched and designed the component upon receiving team feedback, and shipped it to our system.</p>
