## The team and my role
Since I focused on designing the notes experience for our iOS and Android apps. The mobile design lead helped validate questions and give feedback along the way.

The mobile engineering team was responsible for implementing the designs with their PM as a project lead, and one engineer per operating system.

## Research
For this project, the web feature had already been researched and designed by one of my teammates, so my research was heavily informed by the web experience. My researched laid on the mobile implementation of the same experience.

## Final Android Designs
The designs below were the final work submitted to the mobile senior product manager, and ultimately implemented by a senior Android engineer.
