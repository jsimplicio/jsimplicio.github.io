<div class="problem-statement">
	<h2>Problem statement</h2>
	Social media managers want to add calendar notes to help them create reminders and organize their work.
</div>

## The team and my role
Since I focused on designing the notes experience for our iOS and Android apps. The mobile design lead helped validate questions and give feedback along the way.

The mobile engineering team was responsible for implementing the designs with their PM as a project lead, and one engineer per operating system.

## The research
For this project, the web feature had already been designed by my teammate, so my research was heavily done based on the web experience that had already been tested. I also did research in order to implement the same user experience but by relying on user interfaces for each specific mobile OS.

## Final Designs
The designs below were submitted for the mobile senior product manager and senior android engineer.
