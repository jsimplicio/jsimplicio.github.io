We recently launched a home for the dscout web app because the app lacked a clear home page. Researchers would log in and arrive at their last active project. First time researchers would arrive at an empty first project, which is potentially a confusing onboarding experience.

I was lead designer and Scrum Master on building dscout's web app a home. I also lead the redesign of the project page, which we tackled alongside the home project.

### Objectives
* Provide a home for the dscout web app.
* Redesign the project page by using the new API and design system.

### Key Results
* Provide a home for a researcher's projects.
* Provide an improved project page.

### The new home

Dscout's home is dedicated to housing a researcher's projects. On the main content, under the tab "All projects", researchers see a combination of "My Projects" and "Shared with Me" projects.

On the left sidebar, there is a primary call to action to create a new project.

On the right sidebar, there are information on the researcher's account and lastly a help docs and help chat links.

Researchers can use the main content's search bar to quickly look for projects or missions.

When a project is done, a researcher can mark it as complete, think of it as archiving a project. This project will then move to the completed projects tab on the main content.

A researcher is able to delete projects. However there are some caveats. Dscout does not allow researchers to delete projects which contain active or completed (closed) missions or screeners.

If a project is in draft and does not contain any data, researchers are able to delete it.

Below, we see a project which contains the trash icon and projects who don't. This shows the difference between "draft" projects, and projects in progress or containing scout data.
