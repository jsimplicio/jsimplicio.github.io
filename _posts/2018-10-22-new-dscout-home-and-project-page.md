We launched a home for the dscout web app because it lacked a clear home page. Researchers upon logging in, would arrive at the last active project. First time researchers would arrive at an empty first project, which could potentially be a confusing onboarding experience.

I acted as lead designer and Scrum Master on the project of building dscout's web app a home. I also lead the redesign of the dscout project page, which we tackled alongside the home project.

### Objectives
* Provide a home for the dscout web app.
* Redesign the project page by utilizing the power of our new API and design system.

### Key Results
* Provide a home for a researcher's projects.
* Provide an improved project page experience.

### The new home

Dscout's home houses a researcher's projects. On the main content, under the tab "All projects", researchers see a combination of "My Projects" and "Shared with Me" projects.

On the left sidebar, there is a primary call to action to create a new project. We decided to call out this action since it's one of the primary triggers and features on the home page.

On the right sidebar, there are account contact information, and help docs with help chat links.

Researchers can use the main content's search bar to quickly look for projects , missions, or live panels.

When a project is done, a researcher can mark it as complete, as if they're archiving a project. This project will then move to the completed projects tab on the main content.

A researcher is able to delete projects under some caveats. Dscout does not allow researchers to delete projects which contain active or completed (closed) missions or screeners.

If a project is in draft and does not contain any launched missions, researchers are able to delete it.

Below, we see a project which contains the trash icon and projects who don't. This shows the difference between "draft" projects, and in progress projects that can't be deleted.

If a researcher is for example working under a big organization, they may be using different dscout accounts per team. In the following example, you see an account dropdown that lists two different accounts that this researcher is part of. This is the dropdown where a researcher is able to go between dscout accounts.

### The New Project Page

We have broken up what makes part of a dscout project into actionable items.

On the left sidebar, a quick click away to create a screener, mission, or panel.

The main content populates a researchers' diary missions in a container, followed by panels and screeners in the same fashion.

The right sidebar provides contact information about the project lead and dscout contact, with an addition of help links.

</figure>

It's quite easy to create a new screener through the prominent "Create Screener" call to action. A screener can be started froms cratch or copied from a previous one.

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project-2.png" title="Create a new Screener or copy from previous" />
	<figcaption class="media-caption center">Create a new Screener or copy from previous</figcaption>
</figure>

Below the Screener call to action, a researcher can create a Diary mission through a "Create Diary Mission" action. Not only can these be created from scratche or copied from a previous mission, they can also be created based on a template.

<figure>
	<img src="{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/images/project-3.png" title="Create a new Diary Mission, copy from previous, or create from a template" />
	<figcaption class="media-caption center">Create a new Diary Mission, copy from previous, or create from a template</figcaption>
</figure>

There are instances where a researcher might need to move a mission, screener, or panel into another project. For that case, we provide an action through an actionable arrow icon which opens a dropdown where a researcher can pick a project within their account for this mission/panel/screener to be moved to.

Screeners can be deleted if they're in draft mode.
