With the Diary 2.0 experience, researchers can manage scouts through all of the mission parts in Manage.

### Goal
* Allow researchers to keep track of and manage the progress of all scouts in a mission

### Delivery

We released the new Dary, introducing mission parts. Researchers can now divide their mission (research) into multiple parts. Instead of having to manage research data across multiple missions, they can see all of their data divided up into parts in one place.

Manage is essentially a table of scouts from a mission. This table includes information about a scout's progress throghout a mission and all of its parts, while highlighting scout rating, and allowing the researcher to mark a scout as complete (mission accomplished).

Researchers can filter their Manage view by a variety of attributes. On the following image you can see the view of the options for filtering by mission progress: invited to mission, accepted, rejected, and completed the mission.

Researchers can also filter by part progress. Unstarted, in progress, and minimum number of entries completed.
