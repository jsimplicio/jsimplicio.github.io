With the Diary 2.0 experience, researchers can manage scouts through all of the mission parts in Manage.

### Objective
* Allow researchers to keep track of and manage the progress of scouts in a mission

### Keeping track of research participants

We released the new Diary which introduced mission parts. Researchers now can divide their mission into multiple parts. Instead of having to manage research data across multiple missions, they can see all their data divided up into logical parts in one place.

Manage is essentially a powerful table of scouts from a mission. It includes information about a scout's progress through the mission and all of its parts, it highlights scout ratings, and allows the researcher to mark scouts as completed (mission accomplished).

Researchers can filter their Manage view by a variety of attributes. On the following image you can see the view of the options for filtering by mission progress: invited to mission, accepted, rejected, and completed the mission.

Researchers can also filter by part progress. Unstarted, in progress, and minimum number of entries completed.
