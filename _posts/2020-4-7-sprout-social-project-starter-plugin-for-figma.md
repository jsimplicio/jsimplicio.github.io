{% include team_and_role.md %}

I built Sprout Social's first Figma plugin, a file setup and organizer for the product design team. It all started with one of our lead product designers coming up with a system for file covers that represent projects, plus page designs that divide the file's content according to what stage the design is at. The goal of the initial templates was to help everyone in the team organize their files in a way that would be easy for designers, engineers, and product managers to navigate any designer's files.

I turned the templates into a Figma plugin that generates organizational pages and a file cover based on what the user inputs on a form when they load the plugin.

I learned how to use the Figma API to extract the cover designs from a library file so they could be used in the final cover design generated by the plugin. Depending on what the user input in the plugin form they see certain things. Some other customizations include icons that represent what team the project is under, and the project title and squad name.

During this project I became acquainted with the process of writing and shipping a Figma plugin to our organization. I also was responsible to writing communication materials for the plugin launch and teaching the team how to install and use the plugin.
