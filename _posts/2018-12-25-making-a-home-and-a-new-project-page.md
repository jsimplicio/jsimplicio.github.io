We designed and launched a home for the dscout web app. The app lacked a home page. Researchers would log in and arrive at the last active project. First time researchers would arrive at an empty first project, which caused confusion.

I was lead designer and Scrum Master on this project, and I also lead the re-design of the dscout project page, which we tackled alongside building the home.

### Objectives
* Provide a home for the dscout web app.
* Bring the project page to the v4 API.

### Key Results
* The dscout web app has a clear home in its structural design.
* The project page is revitalized with core project information and components.

### The new home

Dscout's home has a main column with a researcher's collection of projects. There is a primary call to action to create a new project to the left of the main column. To the right, there is a sidebar with account contact information, and help docs with help chat links.

Researchers can use the main content's search bar to quickly look for projects , missions, or live panels.

When a project is done, a researcher can mark it as complete, as if they're archiving a project. This project will then move to the completed projects tab on the main content.

There's also the capability to pin projects to the top of the list. This is a power-up for long project lists.

A researcher is able to delete projects under some caveats. Dscout does not allow researchers to delete projects which contain active or completed (closed) missions or screeners.

If a project is in draft and does not contain any launched missions, researchers are able to delete it. Below, we see a project which contains the trash icon and projects which don't.

If a researcher is for example working under a big organization, they may be using different dscout accounts per team. In the following example, you see an account dropdown that lists two different accounts that this researcher is part of. This is the dropdown where a researcher is able to go between dscout accounts.
