During Sprout Social's recent major platform re-design, I helped our engineering and product design teams by identifying patterns across the app which could be re-usable components in our new design system, Seeds. The empty state component was my first major contribution to Seeds, where I identified a need, researched and designed the component upon receiving team feedback, and shipped it to our system.

One thing I would do differently in the future is only accept SVGs so that we can programatically assign the accent color ourselves. As you can see in my examples very similar but different hues of blue from our design system color palette were uploaded as a PNG accidentaly by different designers.
