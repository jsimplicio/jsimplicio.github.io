The product and engineering teams worked on a major redesign of the dscout mobile experience. The new design was born out of the necessity to bring the mobile apps up to date with the new dscout Diary for researchers.

I was tasked with updating the design for the Android application, working alongside our design director, Timo Kuhn, who did the iOS designs. This project was interesting because I had never been an Android user. I had to start by learning Material Design, which was very methodical and quite fun to use.

### Goals
* Update the app to handle the new dscout Diary, with mission parts.
* Bonus: modernize the Android app's outdated design.
* Bonus: handle some aspects of dscout Live in beta.

### Process
I started this project by reading [Google's guide on Material Design](https://material.io/design/). The guide, being thoughtfully laid out, made it easy to find the important nuggets of information necessary to start designing.

I focused on a new experience from login to completing a mission part. I also designed supplemental features, such as an upload progress screen where scouts can track their file uploads.

All of the images below display a brand new experience of scouts with the new reboot of the Diary mission, introducing mission parts.

The following image shows a solution on which I used a default Android OS carousel for an introduction to the app. I designed small illustrations accomplanying each slide.

You can start seeing me utilize Material Design elements such as the inputs, buttons, and overall form design.

On the following designs, the app homepage was rebuilt to support mission opportunities, missions, and live missions. We revised the home to neatly handle projects in progress, new, or closed.

The following flow displays the process of a scout submitting an entry to a Diary mission. On the mission card you can see important information such as how many parts the mission has, Once a scout clicks on a new mission from the home page, they're greated by an overlay with the mission descriptions and specs.
