Dscout Diary went through a redesign with [the introduction of mission parts](/product/design/analyzing-entries-with-dscout/). Missions are now capable of being divided up into parts. The mobile apps required a redesign to handle parts.

I was tasked with updating the design for the Android application, working alongside our design director, Timo Kuhn, who was responsible for the iOS redesign.

### Goal
- Update the Android app to conform to the new scout dscout Diary experience.
	- Bonus: modernize the Android app's outdated design.
	- Bonus: handle some aspects of [dscout Live](https://dscout.com/live) in beta.

### Process
I started by researching and learning from [Google's guide on Material Design](https://material.io/design/).

I focused on the experience from login to completion of a mission part. I also designed additional features, such as an upload progress screen where scouts can track their media uploads.

The images below display the new experience for scouts with the launch of the new dscout Diary.

The following image shows an onboarding carousel design where I created small illustrations to go along each slide.

The following login form shows the use of Material Design elements, such as inputs, buttons, and overall form design practices.

The app home was redesigned to support mission opportunities, missions, and live missions. We revised the layout of the missions home to handle projects in progress, new, or closed under accordions.

The following user flow displays follows a scout submitting an entry to a Diary mission.

Under missions, a scout can navigate to the "new" tab to see new missions they have qualified for. On the mission card important information is displayed, such as how many parts the mission will have.

When a scout clicks on the mission card they are greeted with an overlay with the mission description and the same details the mission card had.

Once a scout accepts the mission through the mission details overlay, they can start to submit entries to open mission parts.

Scouts are able to tell new parts from parts in progress, or from locked parts, by color. New parts are always green, whereas parts that have been started and are in progress are blue. Parts that are locked are grey. Locked parts occur in manual missions where researchers control when to open parts to scouts.

The color differentiation between the parts helps scouts distinguish parts from one another in order to keep progress.
