<div class="problem-statement">
	<h2>Problem statement</h2>
	Researchers need to screen for the best research participants from a pool of hundreds of thousands of people provided by dscout.
</div>

## Choosing your scouts
Screeners go out to hundreds of people, some are an inadequate fit and are knocked out, and hundreds of other applications make in. All participants are screened by answering the same set of questions written to determine whether they are fit for the research study to follow. When answers are submitted, they show up as an application.

Every application comes in as unrated. They are ready to be rated as they see fit by the researcher. Ratings are based on whether a participant is a good fit for the research project based on their experiences, and not solely on their qualifications as a participant.

Potential fit for research ratings are as follow: amazing, good, weak, poor, or unrated.

After launching their research study, researchers can access the Applications page and filter the applications based on participants that were promoted to their study (missions).
