You can't run research projects in dscout without participants. With our tool Recruit, researchers can screen and find the best research participants.

We'll dive into the screening process after a Screener is programmed and launched.

## Choosing your scouts
In "Applications", researchers see the applications from the Screener sent out to hundreds of people. All of the participants answer the same set of questions in the Screener, resulting in applications. Every time someone fills out an application, that data immediately shows up for the researchers.

Every application comes in as unrated, and ready to be rated as they see fit by the researcher. Ratings are purely based on whether a person is a great fit for the research project to follow, and not solely on the quality of the participant.

Potential fit for research ratings are as follow: amazing, good, weak, poor, or unrated.

After launching their research study, researchers can access the Applications page and filter the applications based on participants that were promoted to their study (missions).
