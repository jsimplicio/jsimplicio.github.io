I had the opportunity to go through a residency in our Design Systems team at Sprout Social. During my residency, I focused on three separate projects, one being the design, development and release of Breadcrumb for [Seeds](https://seeds.sproutsocial.com "Sprout Social's Seeds").

## Why Breadcrumb?
Outside of the residency, my team builds Publishing features for Sprout Social. My latest design for Publishing involved an interface where there could be a limitless amount of nested folders. The structure of folders requires a navigation element to help users navigate and locate themselves within the app. This feature called for a breadcrumb component.

## Design proposal
I proposed several different designs for the Breadcrumb component. The designs were based on UX patterns from breadcrumbs. We landed on a design that was conscious of space, provided easy wayfinding and fit within our system.

## Development proposal

I wrote a document outlining the following:
* The definition of breadcrumb
* Proposal component structure
* HTML translation
* Prop Table
* Accessibility considerations
