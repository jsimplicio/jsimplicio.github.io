I had the opportunity to go through a residency in our Design Systems team at Sprout Social. During my residency, I focused on a few projects, one being the design, development and release of Breadcrumb on <a target="_blank" title="Sprout Social's Seeds" href="https://seeds.sproutsocial.com">Seeds â†—</a>.

<div class="problem-statement"> 
<h2>ðŸ’ª The challenge</h2>
To design, build, and release the breadcrumb component. We defined breadcrumbs as small user interface elements used for navigating content in parent-child relationships within pages or overlays. Breadcrumbs should provide context for where users are in a nested hierarchy.
</div>

## Background
Outside of the residency, my team builds Publishing features for Sprout Social. My latest design for Publishing involved an interface where there could be a limitless amount of nested folders. The structure of folders requires a navigation element to help users navigate and locate themselves within the app. This feature called for a breadcrumb component.

## Design proposals and research
I proposed several different designs for the Breadcrumb component based on breadcrumb UX patterns. We landed on a design that was conscious of space, provided easy wayfinding and fit within our system.

## Development proposal

I wrote a document outlining the following:
* The definition of breadcrumb
* Proposal component structure
* HTML translation
* Prop Table
* Accessibility considerations
