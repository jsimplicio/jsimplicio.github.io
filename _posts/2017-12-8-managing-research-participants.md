In the new Diary tool, researchers can manage scouts throughout all parts of the project inside "Manage."

### Objective
* Allow researchers to keep track of, and manage the progress of scouts in a mission.

### Key results
* Researchers quickly communicate with and see the mission progress of scouts.

### Tracking research participants

We released the new Diary which introduced mission parts. Researchers now can divide their mission into multiple parts. Instead of having to manage research data across multiple missions, they can see all their data divided up into logical parts inside one mission.

Manage is a powerful feature for tracking scout progress in a mission. The table of scouts includes the scout part progress, it highlights scout ratings, and it allows researchers to mark scouts as completed (mission accomplished).

On the group sidebar, a researcher can create groups and put scouts in one or more of these groups. Groups help manage scouts progress and analisis of data.

The ratings sidebar allows researchers to filter their view by scouts ratings.

Researchers can filter their Manage view by a variety of attributes. On the following image you can see the view of the options for filtering by mission progress: invited to mission, accepted, rejected, and completed the mission.

Researchers can also filter by part progress. Unstarted, in progress, and minimum number of entries completed.

There are several actions researchers can do by selection one or more scouts on the table.
