Our goal for bringing mission parts to reality for our customers cooked for a year. We delivered the enhanced dscout Diary experience in late 2017.

The new Diary introduced mission parts. Researchers running diary studies no longer have to divide their study into multiple missions where the data is siloed and separated by mission.
