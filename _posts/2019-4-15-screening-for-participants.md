To run a diary or live research study on dscout, researchers need participants. Recruit is the product that equip customers with tools to find and screen research participants.

In the applications view, researchers are able to see the results of the screening survey that they sent out to the pool of dscout research participants. Surveys ultimately are tools to narrow down their search in order to find the perfect candidate that have experiences related to the study to follow.
