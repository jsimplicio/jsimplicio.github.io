---

I spent over two years at dscout helping build and promote adoption of Particle, our first component library which was the foundation to our design system.

Dscout went through a major platform re-design that started as a trial on some parts of the system. This re-design was built with the building blocks of particle. The system is built on React, and back when it first started I generated its counter part UI kit in Sketch for the team.

In a small team of two, I helped the lead designer create a brand new UI language. I documented the [atoms and molecules](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/){:target="_blank"} of every component in Sketch, which I eventually turned into a comprehensive and re-usable UI kit for dscout's product designers. 

I displayed the code of every component above said component. The goal was to show designers how they were being implemented by engineers, and to actually show them the component names we use in code.

Dscout designers utilized the UI kit for designing and prototyping anything from small product ideas, to new features. The UI Kit in Sketch inspired the future switch to building our system in Figma.
