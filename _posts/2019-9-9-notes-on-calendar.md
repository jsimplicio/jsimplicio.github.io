I designed the mobile experience for adding notes to the calendar as my first project at Sprout Social. The web experience was previously designed by one of my teammates.

## The calendar

The publishing calendar is a big part of the platform. It's where social media managers can see and manage their network posts displayed in different calendar views.

## Notes
Being able to add notes to calendars had been a feature requested by our users. It's helpful for them for a number of reasons including giving more flexibility to add important imformation on the calendar. This feature helps social media managers work efficiently with a something they already familiar with, writing a post-it note on a calendar.
