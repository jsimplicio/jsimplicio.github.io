This was my first project as a new product designer at Sprout Social. I joined a team of two very talented designers responsible for Sprout's publishing tools.

## The calendar

The publishing calendar is a big part of the platform. It's where social media managers can see and manage their network posts displayed in different calendar views.

## Notes
Being able to add notes to calendars had been a feature requested by our users. It's helpful for users to plan posts next to important events, for example. Notes is a feature for a plethora of uses, but most importantly, to help social media managers work efficiently with a concept they already familiar with, writing a post-it note on a calendar.
