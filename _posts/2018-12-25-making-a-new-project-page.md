I broke up what makes part of a dscout project into actionable items.

On the left sidebar, a quick click away to create a screener, mission, or panel.

The main content populates a researchers' diary missions in a container, followed by panels and screeners in the same fashion.

The right sidebar provides contact information about the project lead and dscout contact, with an addition of help links.

It's easy to create a new screener through the "Create Screener" call to action. A screener can be started froms cratch or copied from a previous one.

Below the Screener call to action, a researcher can create a Diary mission through the "Create Diary Mission" action. Not only can missions be created from scratch, they can be copied from a previous mission, or be created based on a template.

There are instances where a researcher might need to move a mission, screener, or panel into another project. For that case, we provide an action through an actionable arrow icon which opens a dropdown where a researcher can pick a project within their account for this mission/panel/screener to be moved to.

Screeners can be deleted if they're in draft mode.
