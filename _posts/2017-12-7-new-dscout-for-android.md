The product and engineering teams at dscout worked on a dscout mobile experience that was a major redesign for the iOS and Android apps so that it could handle the new dscout Diary for researchers that was going to be released

I was tasked with updating the design for the dscout Android application, working alongside our design director, Timo Kuhn, who did the designs for iOS. This challenge was interesting because I had never been an Android user. I had to start by learning Material Design, which was very methodical and fun to use.

## Goal
Update and modernize our mobile apps outdated design in order to handle the new dscout Diary, and aspects of dscout Live during its beta.

## Solution
To begin with, there was a ton of reading. I didn't necessarily read the Material Design guides online from beginning to end, but those guides are extremely well laid out and it was easy to find the important nuggets of information I would need to start designing.

*I would also like to thank our mobile engineers who provided guiding feedback throughout this project.*
