## The team and my role
I had the opportunity to go through a residency in our Design Systems team at Sprout Social. During my residency, I focused on a few projects, one being the design, development and release of the Breadcrumb component on <a target="_blank" title="Sprout Social's Seeds" href="https://seeds.sproutsocial.com">Seeds</a>.

Outside of the residency, my actual team builds Publishing features for Sprout Social. My latest design for Publishing involved an interface where there could be a limitless amount of nested folders. The structure of folders requires a navigation element to help users navigate and locate themselves within the app. This feature called for a breadcrumb component.

## Research
I proposed different designs to the team of product designers for the Breadcrumb component based on research and analysis done on breadcrumb UI and UX patterns. The team gave me immediate feedback on the proposed design options during the presentation, so I was able to get feedback on which design direction to take. We landed on a design that was conscious of space, provided easy wayfinding, and fit well within our system.

## Development proposal

When the design proposal was presented and the final design was chosen, I started thinking about how I would build the component. I decided to write a development proposal in order to get input from other engineers.

I wrote a development proposal document outlining the following:
* The definition of the breadcrumb component
* Proposed component structure
* HTML translation
* Prop Table
* Accessibility considerations

By writing a development proposal, I spent time researching other design systems ways of implementing breadcrumbs, which provided me inspiration and ideas of how I would uniquely implement Breadcrumb in our design system.

My proposal provided enough starting material to get actionable feedback from engineers across the company.

After receiving feedback from my engineer peers, I was able to make adjustments to the development strategy. I then proceeded to build the component. By writing a proposal ahead of developing code, I was able to get all of my ideas down and get feedback as well, which made the process of building the actual component very smooth! I was able to receive more code review feedback during this round of the build process.

## Breadcrumb in use
Breadcrumb's first adoption was in Asset Library after we launched the folders feature. It began as a pattern in our design system, and it is now even used in other Sprout apps like Landscape.
