The dscout researcher platform used to have a simple open-ended questions analysis view, that included a basic word cloud based on word frequency. Our team recently made a variety of improvements with new features to help researchers dig into each open-ended question on a brand new analysis view.

## Brief
Researchers need meaningful data from open-ended questions, which are harder to analyze than close-ended questions. The new analysis tab helps them mine this data through new features.

## Objectives
* An analysis view with new features for researchers to analyze open-ended questions.

## Key Results
* Researchers can make value of the answers to open-ended questions.

## The features
The following images belong to a project on customer experience on the personalized monthly make-up box, Birchbox.

Below there is the analysis of the following open-ended question: "Is there anything that's surprising or unexpected, in terms of contents of your box or the overall experience?"

Tools for analysis:

* Question picker
* Filter top words (10, 25, or 50)
* See and filter words by part of speech
* Filter based on the rating of responses (positive, negative, or unrated)
* Eliminate words from the chart by adding them to a stop word list
