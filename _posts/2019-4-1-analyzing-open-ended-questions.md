The Diary team launched a new Analysis tab with improvements that help researchers understand and compare answers to open-ended questions.

## Brief
Researchers should be able to take in meaningful data from answers to open-ended questions. Close-ended questions are easier to quantify, and displayed the results in graphs, like in Summary. With the Analysis tab, researchers are able can dig deep into open-ends by analyzing different patterns.

## Objective
* The Analysis view has features that help researchers analyze the answers to open-ended questions.

## Key Results
* Researchers can quickly make patterns and create value out of answers to open-ended questions.

## The features
The following images belong to a research project that examined the experience of customers that were provided a trial of the [Birchbox](https://www.birchbox.com/) service, a pepersonalized box delivered to your home with a mix of makeup, hair, and skincare products.

For the example of this feature, I posted screenshots of the analysis one of the open-ended questions in the Birchbox project: "Is there anything that's surprising or unexpected, in terms of contents of your box or the overall experience?"

The following are some tools for word analysis:

* Question picker
* Filter top words (10, 25, or 50)
* See and filter words by part of speech
* Filter based on the rating of responses (positive, negative, or unrated)
* Eliminate words from the chart by adding them to a stop word list
