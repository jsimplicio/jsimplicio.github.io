The diary team recently launched a new analysis tab with improvements and features that help researchers understand the answer to open-ended questions.

## Brief
Researchers need to gather meaningful data from the answers of open-ended questions. Close-ended questions are easily quantifiable and displayed as graphs in the summary tab. With the analysis tab, researchers are able to dig deeper into open-ended answers, and form patterns based on open-ended-questions.

## Objectives
* The analysis view comes with new features for researchers to analyze open-ended questions.

## Key Results
* Researchers can quickly create value out of the answers to open-ended questions.

## The features
The following images belong to a research project that examined the experience of customers that were provided a trial of the [Birchbox](https://www.birchbox.com/) service, a pepersonalized box delivered to your home with a mix of makeup, hair, and skincare products.

For the example of this feature, I posted screenshots of the analysis one of the open-ended questions in the Birchbox project: "Is there anything that's surprising or unexpected, in terms of contents of your box or the overall experience?"

The following are some tools for word analysis:

* Question picker
* Filter top words (10, 25, or 50)
* See and filter words by part of speech
* Filter based on the rating of responses (positive, negative, or unrated)
* Eliminate words from the chart by adding them to a stop word list
