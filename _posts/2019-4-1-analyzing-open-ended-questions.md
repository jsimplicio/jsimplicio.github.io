The Diary team launched a new Analysis tab with improvements that give researchers the ability to quantify data from open-ended answers. Close-ended answers can be easier to quantify in charts, like the data seen in the Summary tab.

{% include problem_statement.md %}

## Objective
* The Analysis feature has features that help researchers researchers get a quick understanding of open-ended answers through tools that generate patterns.

## Key Result
* Researchers can quickly create meaningful value out of answers to open-ended questions.

## The features
The following images belong to a research project that examined the experience of customers that were provided a trial of the [Birchbox](https://www.birchbox.com/) service, a personalized box delivery subscription.

The following are screenshots on the analysis of one of the open-ended questions in the Birchbox project: "Is there anything that's surprising or unexpected, in terms of contents of your box or the overall experience?"

The following are the filter tools provided for word analysis:

* Question picker
* Filter top words (10, 25, or 50)
* See and filter words by part of speech
* Filter based on the rating of responses (positive, negative, or unrated)
* Eliminate words from the chart by adding them to a stop word list
