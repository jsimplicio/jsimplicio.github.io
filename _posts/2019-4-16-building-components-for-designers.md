I spent over two years at dscout helping build and promote the adoption of Particle, our first component library, and the foundation to our design system.

Dscout went through a major platform re-design. The re-design was possible via the building blocks of Particle, which was founded by our small team of two product designers and one front-end engineer.

I helped the lead designer create our brand new UI language by designing new patterns and components and even creating and shipping code. Our designs ended up turning into a React component library created by our lead front-end engineer. Engineers accessed and developed components on the kit via [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org){:target="_blank"}.

### Components for designers

I documented the [atoms and molecules](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/){:target="_blank"} of every component in Sketch, which I eventually turned into a comprehensive and reusable UI kit. 

I displayed the code of every component documented. The goal was to show designers how components are laid out in code by engineers, so they can communicate with engineers.

Dscout designers utilized the UI kit for designing and prototyping anything from small product ideas, to new features. The UI Kit in Sketch inspired the future switch to building our library in Figma.

The component library helps designers explore hundreds of options and brainstorm different designs by relying on existing patterns. The library also helps designers and developers speak the same language, work efficiently, and ship interfaces that the team is proud of. The library also helps engineers interpret design hand-offs and implement them following our common interface language.

The new dscout not only has a new API but a brand new design language, with not only visual pieces, but interaction nuances and patterns.
