{% include team_and_role.md %}

I built Sprout Social's first Figma plugin, a file setup and organizer for the product design team. It all started with one of our lead product designers coming up with a system for file covers that represent projects, plus page designs that divide the file's content according to what stage the design is at. The goal of the initial templates was to help everyone in the team organize their files in a way that would be easy for designers, engineers, and product managers to navigate any designer's files.

I turned the templates into a Figma plugin that generates organizational pages and a file cover based on what the user inputs on a form when they load the plugin. The plugin also include helper pages with layout wireframes to get you started and prepare your file for presentation and hand off.

## How it works 
I learned how to use the Figma API to extract the cover designs from a library file by their component ID. Using components is particularly exciting because we can update designs in Figma and push them as updates without having to touch the code! The cover designs are used in the cover generated by the plugin. The cover has content that is generated by the user input from the form. Depending on what's selected on the form, a certain theme is chosen. The cover includes icons that represent what team the project is under, and the project title and squad name.

During this project I became acquainted with the process of writing and shipping a Figma plugin to our organization. I also was responsible for launching the plugin internally and teaching the team how to install and use it.
