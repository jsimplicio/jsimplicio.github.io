{% include team_and_role.md %}

I spent over two years at dscout helping build and promote the adoption of Particle, our first component library, and the foundation to our design system.

Dscout went through a major platform re-design. The re-design was possible via the building blocks of Particle, which was founded by our small team of two product designers and one front-end engineer.

I helped the lead designer create our brand new UI language by designing new patterns and components and even creating and shipping code. Our designs ended up turning into a React component library created by our lead front-end engineer. Engineers accessed and developed components on the kit via [Storybook](https://storybook.js.org){:target="_blank"}.

I also documented the [atoms and molecules](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/){:target="_blank"} of every component in Sketch, which I eventually turned into a comprehensive and reusable UI kit. 

I displayed the code of every component documented in Sketch. The goal was to show designers how they were being implemented by engineers, actual component names, props and all, so designers could learn a bit of Web Components (in our case, React) and how to talk to engineers better.

Dscout designers utilized the UI kit for designing and prototyping anything from small product ideas, to new features. The UI Kit in Sketch inspired the future switch to building our library in Figma.

The component library helps designers explore hundreds of options and brainstorm designs creatively. The library also helps designers and developers speak the same language so that we work efficiently and ship interfaces we are proud of. The library helps engineers interpret design hand-offs and implement them following our common language.

When questions arise during the build or design phase, we point to our system to make sure we are creating experiences with the right tools at hand, while maintaining consistency throghout the application.

The new dscout not only has a new API but a brand new design language, with not only visual pieces, but interaction nuances and patterns.
