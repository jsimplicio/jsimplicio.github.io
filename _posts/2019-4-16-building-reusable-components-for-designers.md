{% include team_and_role.md %}

I spent over two years at dscout helping build and promote the adoption of Particle, our first component library, and the foundation to our design system.

Dscout went through a major platform re-design. The re-design was possible via the building blocks from Particle, which was founded by our small team of two product designers and one front-end engineer.

I helped the lead designer create our brand new UI language by generating new patterns and components via design and even pushing some to code. Our designs ended up turning into a component library created by our lead front-end engineer. Engineers accessed the kit via Storyboard. I spent a lot of my time tweaking components, creating, and shipping new components that were consumned by our engineers.

For the product design team, I documented the [atoms and molecules](https://bradfrost.com/blog/post/atomic-web-design/){:target="_blank"} of every component in Sketch, which I eventually turned into a comprehensive and reusable UI kit. 

I displayed the code of every component documented. The goal was to show designers how they were being implemented by engineers, actual component names, props and all, so designers could learn a bit of Web Components (in our case, React) and how to talk to engineers better.

Dscout designers utilized the UI kit for designing and prototyping anything from small product ideas, to new features. The UI Kit in Sketch inspired the future switch to building our system in Figma.
