One of the last projects I contributed to at dscout was the public share links feature for research projects. With this feature, researchers can publicly share media from their project.

## Getting started with share links
Every generated link will have a home inside the project share links at the project home page.

Researchers will have access to a designated container with a call-to-action to the project link manager on the rightmost project sidebar.

The example below highlights how many links a project contain directly in the call to action, a nice to have.

The project link manager itself is a simple table of links shared and stats pertaining to the sharing. Researchers can navigate to those links via the manager to edit link settings.

If we navigate to the link "Test!" we can see link's settings. Some major features to point out is the ability to delete such share link, to set an access code for people to access the content behind the share link, set link expiration, and even share it to designated Slack channels.

## Creating a link

While analyzing their projects, researchers will come upon photo and video media that they may feel compalled to share with colleagues outside of dscout. they will stumble upon certain medias that can be shared.

For the first time, researchers can give a glimpse of their project to outside colleagues by using the public share links feature.

Once they choose media that they want to  share, they click on a sharing button on the media and are greeted with the sharing modal below.

The first step to sharing media is to click on "Generate public share link" once they open the sharing modal
