One of the last projects I designed at dscout was the public share links feature. With this feature researchers can publicly share media from their project.

Links live in a project's sphere only, not globally across all projects in an account.

Researchers find a call-to-action for each project link manager on the project home's right sidebar.

The project link manager is a table of links shared. Researchers can navigate to those links via the manager to edit link settings.
