  <p>Over the past 5 years, I researched, designed, built, and shipped mobile and web experiences used by thousands of people.</p>

  <p>I currently design experiences at <a target="_blank" title="Sprout Social" href="https://sproutsocial.com">Sprout Social</a> that bring humans together.
  </p>

  <p>In the past, I designed and developed research products at <a target="_blank" title="dscout mobile research" href="https://dscout.com">dscout</a>. I designed e-commerce experiences at <a target="_blank" href="http://threadless.com" title="Threadless">Threadless</a>, and for their on-demand print service, <a href="https://www.threadless.com/artist-shops/signup/art" title="Artist Shops">Artist Shops</a>. I also designed for Basecampers, and for the web at <a target="_blank" href="http://basecamp.com" title="Basecamp">Basecamp</a>.</p>

  <p>I enjoy participating in dialogues about design.
