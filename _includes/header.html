    <blockquote>As a mentor, they worked one-on-one with designers for several weeks; as a critic, they worked with a full cohort for an afternoon. In every instance, they provided thoughtful, specific feedback and truly cared about making it a growth experience for the students they worked with...Jules never fails to provide it, and never hesitates to say yes when asked to help more designers. Their dedication to helping the design community grow and flourish in Chicago is a prime example for our students, our other mentors and critics, and designers across the city.

      Jules mentored and supported me after I graduated from a UX bootcamp (Designation) and began searching for my first job in the field. Jules was an empathetic mentor who got to know me as a person so that they could guide me towards opportunities that fit with my personal and professional objectives. Jules' thoughtful advice and wealth of industry knowledge was invaluable to me as a young designer!
