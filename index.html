  <h1 class="font--size-xl">Hey, I'm Jules. I design and code.</h1>
  <p>Lately I have been designing an iOS app, and <a target="_blank" href="https://twitter.com/julessimplicio/status/1352379604967817218?s=20" title="building it with SwiftUI">building it with SwiftUI</a>.</p>
  <p class="pb--none">At <a target="_blank" title="work" href="https://sproutsocial.com">work</a>, I design and develop publishing tools for social media managers while leaning heavily on the adoption and promotion of our design system.<p>
  <p class="pb--none">During our product design and build phases I help software teams adhere to UX patterns, and often help with the creation and promotion of new ones too. I have introduced consistency in our application design by following systems guidelines, and have been a design systems evangelist by consistently educating others and promoting org-wide systems adoption.</p>
