  <h1 class="font--size-xl">Hey, I'm Jules. I design and code.</h1>
  <p>Lately I have been designing an iOS app for anyone who wants quick access to their design system's <a target="_blank" href="https://css-tricks.com/what-are-design-tokens/" title="tokens">tokens</a>, and <a target="_blank" title="building it with SwiftUI" href="https://twitter.com/julessimplicio/status/1352379604967817218?s=20">building it with SwiftUI</a>.</p>
  <p>At <a target="_blank" href="https://sproutsocial.com" title="work">work</a>, I design and develop publishing tools for social media managers while leaning heavily on the adoption and promotion of our design system.</p>
  <p>During our product build phases, I help software teams adhere to UX patterns, and often help with the creation and promotion of new ones too. I have also introduced and promoted consistency in our application by being a member of our UI Kit team.</p>
  <p class="pb--none">I am a systems promoter who consistently educates others on systems guidelines and promotes org-wide systems adoption.</p>
